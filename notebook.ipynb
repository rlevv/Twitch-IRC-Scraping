    "\n",
    "To stream messages from Twitch IRC you need to get a to token for authentication. To do that you need to:\n",
    "1. Create a Twitch account \n",
    "2. Go to https://twitchapps.com/tmi/ to request an auth token for your Twitch account. You'll need to click \"Connect with Twitch\" and \"Authorize\" to produce a token\n",
